# Mastering Behavior-Driven Development Using Cucumber

Practice and Implement Page Object Design Pattern, Test Suites in Cucumber, POM TestNG Integration, Cucumber Reports, and work with Selenium Grid

This is the repository for [Mastering Behavior-Driven Development Using Cucumber](https://in.bpbonline.com/products/mastering-behavior-driven-development-using-cucumber?_pos=1&_sid=28f17708c&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications.

## About the Book
In this book, readers will learn everything they need to know about Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and a framework used for automation testing for BDD.
The book is divided into three sections. The first section covers the building blocks of Cucumber such as Feature files, Step Definition classes, and Runner classes, among other things. These will serve as the building blocks for becoming more familiar with Cucumber.

The second section covers the Page Object design pattern and Page Factories, both of which are useful in developing robust frameworks.

The final section demonstrates Cucumber's integration with TestNG and Maven. We will be putting each Maven build in Jenkins and configuring Jenkins to trigger automatically when a development build is completed.
After reading this book, the test engineer will understand the concept of incorporating Cucumber as a BDD framework into his testing. As a result, he will be able to streamline the testing and bug detection processes.
